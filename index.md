## Welcome to [(justinxhale's)](https://github.com/JustinXHale){:target="_blank"} InstructLab Onboarding Documentation (for MacOS)

This project is dedicated to streamlining the onboarding process for InstructLab, a powerful tool for training and interacting with large language models (LLMs). Designed with UX designers, SMEs, and non-technical users in mind, this documentation provides a clear, step-by-step guide to installing, configuring, and using InstructLab on **macOS**.

## Get Started
Explore the documentation
- [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md)
- [Installation Guide](install.md)

The workflow has been broken into five intuitive parts:

- **Prerequisities** - What you need to get started
- **Install** – Setting up installing InstructLab.
- **Run/Chat** – Using InstructLab for model interaction.
- **Learn/Contribute** – Adding new knowledge and skills to the model.
- **Train** – Training the model with new data.

## By following this documentation, users will:

- Gain a better understanding of how to work with InstructLab.
- Set up their environment efficiently.
- Contribute to upstream repositories with ease.
- Train and fine-tune models locally.

# Why This Approach?
In its current state, the InstructLab onboarding process assumes a level of technical expertise that may be intimidating for non-technical users. This documentation simplifies the process by:

- **Introducing Interactive Mode**: Users can choose step-by-step guidance within the CLI or proceed manually. Interactive Mode keeps users within the CLI environment, avoiding unnecessary navigation to external resources.
- **Combining Taxonomies**: The updated workflow uses a single taxonomy setup, reducing complexity and ensuring all contributions can be easily managed and shared upstream.
- **Clear User Flow**: The four-part structure helps users focus on one task at a time while maintaining a logical sequence.

### This method was chosen to align with the goals of InstructLab:

- Enable users to train LLMs locally with minimal barriers.
- Encourage collaboration by simplifying contributions to upstream repositories.
- Provide a consistent user experience across the installation, usage, and learning phases.

# Hope to accomplish
- Simplified Onboarding: Interactive Mode reduces cognitive load by guiding users through the setup process.
- Minimized Errors: Pre-configured options and defaults lower the likelihood of mistakes during installation and configuration.
- User-Centric: Designed for both technical and non-technical users, making InstructLab more accessible.
- Streamlined Contributions: Automating steps like forking and cloning repositories ensures users can contribute back to the upstream model with minimal effort.
- Future-Ready: A consistent and well-documented process sets the stage for future improvements and features.

By integrating tools like **GitHub CLI** and leveraging user-friendly commands, we reduce the reliance on external tools or advanced command-line knowledge, focusing on what matters: building and improving LLMs.
