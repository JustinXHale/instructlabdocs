# Enhance ilab model serve with Interactive Model Selection and Category Filtering

# Current Process Overview:
- Users serve a model by executing *ilab model serve <PATH>.*
- If no path is specified, the default model, _Granite_, is served.
- To serve a different model, users must:
    - Manually locate the path to the model file.
    - Enter the correct path when running the ilab model serve command.

# Key Pain Points for Users:
1. _Manual Path Entry:_ The user has to locate and type the full path for each model, which is very cumbersome and error-prone.
2. _Model Visibility:_ It is difficult for the user to find out what models are available and where they are kept.
3. _Default Assumption:_ Serving the Granite model by default may not be aligned with user needs or preferences.

# Proposed Enhancements:
1. Interactive Model Selection (*serve_model*)
Introduce an interactive mode that allows users to select from a list of available models when running *ilab model serve* without specifying a path.

Example:

```
$ ilab model serve

Available models:
1. granite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf (Default)
2. mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf
3. merlinite-7b-lab-Q4_K_M.gguf

Enter the number of the model you want to serve [Press Enter for default]: 2
```
- _Default Option:_ If the user presses Enter without selecting a model, the first model (Granite) will be served.
- Benefits:
    - Reduces manual errors.
    - Improves discoverability of available models.
    - Simplifies the workflow for new and experienced users.

## Scalable Enhancement (future)
For users who may have a large number of downloaded models, introduce a category-based filter.

Example:

```
$ ilab model serve
Available Categories:
1. Interaction Models
2. Teacher Models
3. Fine-Tuning/Testing Models
4. Pre-trained Models
5. Domain-Specific Models

Enter the number of the category you want to explore [Press Enter for default category (Interaction Models)]: 2

Available Models in "Teacher Models":
1. mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf
2. teacher-guided-3b-v1.0

Enter the number of the model you want to serve [Press Enter for default]: 1

You selected: mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf
Serving model...
```
# Benefits of This Approach:
1. _Improved Model Visibility:_ It allows users to see at once the models available, grouped by categories for better finding of the right model for specific tasks.
2. _Faster Selection Process:_ Instead of manually typing the path to a model, users can quickly browse categories and select from an indexed list.
3. _Scalable to Large Model Repositories:_ When there is an addition of more and more models within InstructLab, the selection would maintain clarity.
